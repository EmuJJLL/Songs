Setlist and charts by Naonemeu
Credits to Alexx Santos for the chart "Oficina G3 - Depois da Guerra (Live)"

 Project Start: 2019-03-31
 Finished (Version 1a): 2020-07-24 
 

	--- Version 2c - 2021-09-15
	
The "2c" update contains changes that make better use of optimizations 
introduced in the Public Test Build (future "v1") of Clone Hero

There are no changes in charts since version 2a (and charts will likely be in a 
"static" state - to prevent online issues)
	
Check on Youtube or the spreadsheet for setlist updates!
I may have let slip some issues,it's always good to check

Previous versions: 2a ; 1b ; 1a
 
 
	--- Important
	
Use the "streamerfriendly.zip" to "censor" some album covers that may be considered "inappropriate" (Useful for streamers)
	
All charts have all diffs,however,they were made AUTOMATICALLY with Onyx/CAT (https://github.com/mtolly/onyxite-customs)
Because of this,don't expect very good charts on lower diffs.


	--- How to Install


Extract the "Lisarb2" folder to where you usually have your Clone Hero songs.
example: "C:\Users\usuario\Documents\CH\CloneHero\Songs"

(No longer relevant)
If you want to remove the round "CH" icon from the albuns,place the file 'lisarb2.png' inside the icon folder
example: "C:\Users\usuario\Documents\CH\CloneHero\Custom\Image Backgrounds"
Após extrair,use a opção de escanear as pastas.

	--- About

	
Hey,thanks for downloading Lisarb 2!
idk how many of the songs you're going to recorgnize,as is there's alot of bands/artists that aren't known
outside of Brazil (aside from Progressive/Power Metal ones,chances are you are going to recorgnize them)
 
In case you make videos or streams with those songs, I'd be thankful if you mentioned this setlist.

This setlist was inspired by "GH Brazucas" from Orkut - GH Creators, and "Brasil Hero" from FoF Brasil.

Lastly,have fun. (guessing what the songs mean)
